# Cowabunga

## Overview

A react-in-rails surf app created to help surfers keep tabs on their favorite surf spots and decide where to catch the best conditions. After signing up you can create a collection and add any tracked surfspots. From there, you can quickly scan your locations for any that have the "greenlight" -- meaning that spot has ideal surf conditions.


## Features

- [x] Custom collections to keep track of your favorite surfspots
